# TwoPhotonModeling

A group of codes for modeling two-photon transitions in a variety of atoms. No guarantee of accuracy, but hopefully this is helpful to someone

* RepRateCalculator: For calculating the apparent seperation in frequency of all two-photon transitions expected in your frequency window. You must manually enter the frequency of the transitions within the "fs" array, and the corresponding linestrength in the "as".
